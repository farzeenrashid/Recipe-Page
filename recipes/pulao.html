            <strong>Description</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            In Pakistan, pulao is a popular dish cooked with basmati rice and meat, usually either mutton or beef. 
            Pulao is a rice dish, cooked in seasoned broth with rice, meat, and an array of spices including: coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cloves and others.
            Yakhni means broth or stock. So Yakhni Pulao is made by simmering bone-in meat to create a broth, which is then used to cook the rice.
            Popular South Asian dishes like biryani were derived from pulao. 
            The difference between biryani and pulao is that biryani is made using the draining method of cooking, which basically means the rice is par-boiled in water, and then drained, dried and used to layer up. 
            Pulao on the other hand, is made through the absorption method, so the amount of water or stock is completely absorbed by the rice and vegetables in the dish.
