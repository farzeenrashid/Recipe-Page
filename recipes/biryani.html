        <strong>Description</strong>
    </h3>

        Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia. It is a special occasion dish.
        It's made from long-grained rice flavoured with spices such as saffron and layered with meat and thick gravy.
        This dish is then covered, its lid secured and then cooked over a low flame.
        Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Thailand, and Malaysia.
        In Pakistan, biryani is served at weddings, Eid parties, for Iftar after a long day of fasting, and many other festive as well as mundane occasions.

    <h3>
        <strong>History</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Biryani originated in Iran, hence the word “biryani” coming from the Persian word “birian” which means “fried before cooking.” 
        Many historians believe that biryani was brought to India by the Mughals. 
        Biryani was further developed in the Mughal royal kitchen.
        An interesting story traces the origins of biryani to Mumtaz Mahal (1593-1631), a queen who inspired the Taj Mahal. 
        It is said that she once visited army barracks and found the army personnel under-nourished. 
        She asked the chef to prepare a special dish that provided balanced nutrition, and thus biryani was created.

            <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 pounds mutton/goat pieces cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
        <strong>Directions</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add goat and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until goat is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when goat is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in rice with goat until coated with spices.</li>
            <li>Stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
        </ol>
