    <h3>
        <strong>History</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Bhindia (known as okra) originated from present-day Ethiopia, the mountainous or plateau portion of Eritrea, and the eastern, higher part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
        It is said to have travelled with the Bantu tribe who migrated from Egypt around 2000 BC. Soon it was growing along the great river valleys of India and China.
